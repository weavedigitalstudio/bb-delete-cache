## 🛠 What is this?

This plugin allows you to **clear Beaver Builder cache** directly from the WordPress admin bar.  

### 🚀 New in this version (1.1.1):
- ✅ **Restricted access to Editors and Admins only** (`edit_pages` capability required).  
- ✅ **Fixed nonce verification issues** for security.  
- ✅ **Improved sanitization & escaping** to follow WordPress coding standards.  
- ✅ **Now actively maintained by [Weave](https://github.com/weavedigitalstudio/)**.

## ⚡️ Why Use This Plugin?

Beaver Builder caches assets to improve performance, but sometimes, **changes don’t appear instantly**. This plugin adds a **"Clear Cache" button** to the WordPress admin bar, so you can:  

- **Clear cache for the current page**  
- **Clear cache for the entire website**  
- **Avoid clearing Beaver Builder cache manually via FTP**
