## ⚡️ Why Use This Plugin?
Beaver Builder caches assets to improve performance, but sometimes, **changes don’t appear instantly**. This plugin adds a **"Clear Cache" button** to the WordPress admin bar, so you can:
- **Clear cache for the current page**
- **Clear cache for the entire website**
- **Avoid clearing Beaver Builder cache manually via FTP**

The Weave team has **updated and now actively maintains** this plugin to support **modern WordPress and PHP versions**.
